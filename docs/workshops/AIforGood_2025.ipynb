        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Built upon Meta’s Segment Anything Model ([SAM](https://ai.meta.com/sam2)), the [SAMGeo](https://samgeo.gishub.org) Python package brings advanced segmentation capabilities to geospatial data. This hands-on workshop is tailored for geospatial enthusiasts, researchers, and professionals eager to unlock the potential of GeoAI in their projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Participants will explore how to leverage SAMGeo for accurate and efficient image segmentation of satellite and aerial imagery. The workshop includes step-by-step demonstrations and practical exercises covering:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Introduction to SAM and SAMGeo:** Learn the architecture and functionality of SAM and its transformative applications in geospatial analysis.\n",
        "-   **Data Preparation:** Prepare geospatial datasets with multi-spectral channels for segmentation tasks.\n",
        "-   **Hands-On with SAMGeo:** Leverage SAMGeo to segment geospatial features (e.g., buildings, trees, water bodies) using prompts such as point coordinates, bounding boxes, and text.\n",
        "-   **Postprocessing Techniques:** Calculate geometric properties of segmented features, filter results, and extract meaningful insights.\n",
        "-   **Data Visualization:** Visualize object masks and segmented features in standard geospatial formats for analysis and reporting.\n",

        "## Introduction to SAM and SAMGeo\n",
        "\n",
        "The Segment Anything Model ([SAM](https://segment-anything.com)), introduced by Meta AI in April 2023, represents a significant advancement in computer vision, particularly in the field of image segmentation. Designed as a promptable segmentation model, SAM is capable of generating accurate segmentation masks based on various prompts, such as points, bounding boxes, or textual inputs. A notable feature of SAM is its zero-shot transfer ability, allowing it to adapt to new image distributions and tasks without additional training. This adaptability is largely attributed to its training on the extensive [SA-1B dataset](https://ai.meta.com/datasets/segment-anything/), which comprises over 1 billion segmentation masks across 11 million images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Building upon the foundation laid by SAM, Meta AI released Segment Anything Model 2 ([SAM 2](https://ai.meta.com/sam2/)) in August 2024. SAM 2 extends the capabilities of its predecessor by introducing real-time, promptable object segmentation in both images and videos. This unified model achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling fast and precise selection of any object in any visual context. Key enhancements in SAM 2 include improved accuracy and processing speed, advanced prompting techniques, and the ability to handle video segmentation tasks seamlessly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Building on the success of SAM and SAM 2, the SAMGeo Python package extends these capabilities to geospatial data. SAMGeo empowers users to perform advanced image segmentation tasks on satellite and aerial imagery, enabling the extraction of valuable insights from geospatial datasets. By leveraging the power of SAMGeo, geospatial professionals can streamline their workflows, enhance data analysis, and unlock new possibilities in remote sensing applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more information on SAM and SAMGeo, please check out the slides from here: <https://bit.ly/aiforgood-samgeo>.\n",
